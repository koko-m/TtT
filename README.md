# TtT (Terms to Transducers)
A simulation tool of transducers generated by the *Memoryful GoI*
framework (http://koko-m.github.io/TtT/).

## What is TtT?
Given a lambda-term with probabilistic choice operators
`choose(p,M,N)`, the Memoryful GoI framework generates its translation
to a *transducer*.
A transducer, that is here a "probabilistic" Mealy machine, is
depicted as a diagram.
This tool simulates execution of the resulting transducer by showing
how a token moves around the diagram.
