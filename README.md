# TtT (Terms to Transducers)
A simulation tool of transducers generated by the *Memoryful GoI*
framework (http://koko-m.github.io/TtT/).

## What is TtT?
Given a lambda-term with probabilistic choice operators
`choose(p,M,N)`, the Memoryful GoI framework generates its translation
to a *transducer*.
A transducer, that is here a "probabilistic" Mealy machine, is
depicted as a diagram.
This tool simulates execution of the resulting transducer by showing
how a token moves around the diagram.

## Usage
(To appear.)

### Accepted Terms
This tool adopts a Scheme-like grammar.

    <var> := {variables}
    <nat> := {natural numbers}
    <prob> := {real numbers in the unit interval [0,1]}
    <expr> ::= <var>  # variables
             | <nat>  # natural numbers
             | *      # the unit value
             | (lambda (<var>) <expr>)     # abstraction
             | (rec (<var> <var>) <expr>)  # recursion
             | (<expr> <expr>)             # application
             | (choose (<prob>) <expr> <expr>)
               # probabilistic choice
               ## the left term executed with probability <prob>
               ## the right term executed with probability 1 - <prob>
             | (car <expr>) | (cdr <expr>) | (cons <expr> <expr>)
               # pairs (product types)
             | (inl <expr>) | (inr <expr>)
             | (match <expr> ((inl <var>) <expr>) ((inr <expr>) <expr>))
               # pattern match (coproduct types)
             | (+ <expr> <expr>)
               # summation (arithmetic primitive)
